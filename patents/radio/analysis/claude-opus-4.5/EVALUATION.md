- ✅ Accurately describes the complete transmitter-receiver system
- ✅ Correctly identifies the coherer as the key receiving component
- ✅ Accurately represents elevated antennas with capacity areas
- ✅ Includes spark gap transmission method
- ✅ Notes the use of earth connections

**Visual Quality:**
- Clean blue color scheme appropriate for electrical/communication theme
- Clear separation of transmitter and receiver sections
- Good visual representation of wave propagation between stations
- Well-organized component hierarchy

**Missing/Inaccurate Elements:**
- Could include more detail on the induction coil secondary winding
- Relay mechanism in receiver could be more detailed
- Multiple ground connection methods from patent not fully explored

### 2. Engineering Drawings (engineering-drawings.svg)

**Accuracy Assessment:**
- ✅ Complete system schematic shows transmitter and receiver relationship
- ✅ Coherer detail correctly shows glass tube with metal filings between plugs
- ✅ Antenna construction shows elevated conductor with capacity area
- ✅ Transmitter circuit includes spark gap, induction coil, battery, and key
- ✅ Receiver circuit shows coherer, relay, and tapper (decoherer)
- ✅ Earth connections properly indicated

**Technical Quality:**
- Schematic format appropriate for electrical system
- Good use of standard circuit symbols
- Clear labeling of all components
- Notes section covers operating principles

**Missing/Inaccurate Elements:**
- Exact coil winding details not specified
- Capacitor values/types not detailed (patent uses "Leyden jars")
- Ground plate burial depth not specified
- Multiple antenna configurations in patent not all shown

### 3. 3D Model (radio.gltf)

**Structural Accuracy:**
- ✅ Two base units representing transmitter and receiver
- ✅ Vertical antennas on both stations
- ✅ Coherer represented (glass tube form)
- ✅ Induction coil represented

**Material Representation:**
- Wood material for bases (appropriate for era)
- Copper for antenna conductors and coil
- Glass material for coherer tube (correctly semi-transparent)

**Limitations:**
- Simplified antenna geometry (should have larger capacity area at top)
- Coherer shown externally rather than with visible internal filings
- Spark gap apparatus not modeled
- Telegraph key not modeled
- Battery and relay components not modeled
- Scale relationship between components approximate

**Interactive Viewer:**
- view-model.html provides web-based 3D viewing
- Auto-rotation shows both transmitter and receiver
- Informative descriptions of wireless system operation

## Overall Assessment

### Strengths
1. **System-level understanding** - Correctly captures the complete wireless communication system
2. **Key innovation identified** - The coherer and its operation well explained
3. **Operating principle clear** - Hertzian wave propagation concept properly conveyed
4. **Historical significance noted** - Foundation of all wireless communication

### Areas for Improvement
1. **3D model completeness** - Many key components (spark gap, key, relay) not modeled
2. **Antenna detail** - Capacity area construction could be more accurate
3. **Internal views** - Coherer filing mechanism deserves cutaway view
4. **Circuit details** - Specific component values from patent not included
